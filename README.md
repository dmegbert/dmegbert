<details>
    <summary>Things that demotivate me</summary>

1. **Long periods of working in isolation:** While I enjoy focused, heads-down work -- I also enjoy
working with others. This is inclusive of folks outside of engineering and can be as simple as a brief
slack conversation or some discussion in GitHub during a code review.
2. **Low standards:** I strive to do quality work and continually learn so that the quality of that
work is improving over time. I find it challenging to work with folks who are not interested in doing
high-quality work and are not receptive to feedback on ways to improve.
3. **Silos:** Having software engineers only work with engineers is not a great way to do this work.
Creating software is best when it includes many, diverse voices. These cross-functional teams and
inclusive product development practices to lead to better results (and a more enjoyable working
environment.)
